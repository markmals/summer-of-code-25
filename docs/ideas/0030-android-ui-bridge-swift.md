**Project size**: 3‚ÄØmonths

**Estimated difficulty**: Hard

### Recommended Skills

- Strong proficiency in Swift (including generics, macros, and SwiftPM plugins)
- Solid understanding of Android‚Äëlevel UI APIs (`android.view.*`, `android.widget.*`)
- Experience with JNI and/or [**swift‚Äëjava/JavaKit**](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-java)
- Familiarity with SwiftUI or [Tokamak](https://github.com/TokamakUI/Tokamak) rendering internals
- Basic knowledge of Gradle/AGP and Android build tooling

### Description

Swift is rapidly expanding beyond Apple platforms. Thanks to **swift‚Äëjava**, it is now
possible to call Java APIs directly from Swift‚Äîbut there is no ergonomic UI
abstraction for Android yet.

This project will create a _first‚Äëclass bridge_ that lets Swift code instantiate and
manipulate native Android `View` hierarchies, while exposing them to the SwiftUI declarative
framework Tokamak.

Concretely, you will:

1. Design a lightweight "widget" layer that maps Android `View` types to Swift classes
   generated by **Java2Swift**.
2. Implement a renderer that plugs into Tokamak‚Äôs reconciler, performing diff‚Äëbased updates
   on the Android UI thread.
3. Package the bridge as a SwiftPM library deliverable as a `.so` for embedding in a
   standard Gradle project, with helper Gradle scripts to bundle Swift stdlib slices.

By the end of the summer, anyone should be able to write:

```swift [main.swift]
@main
struct Hello: View {
   var body: some View {
      VStack {
         Text("Hello, Android!")
         Button("Tap me") { print("üçª") }
      }
      .padding()
   }
}
```

‚Ä¶and see it run natively inside an `Activity`, rendered by pure Swift.

### Expected Results

- **Working renderer** that covers core primitives (`TextView`, `Button`, `LinearLayout`,
  `FrameLayout`, image loading, basic theming) and supports state updates & layout passes.
- **SwiftPM package** `AndroidTokamakRenderer` with clear installation docs.
- **Gradle helper plugin** that downloads the compiled `.so` and wires `System.loadLibrary`.
- **Sample app** showcasing a small Tokamak demo compiled & running on an emulator/device.

<!-- - **Comprehensive test suite** (unit + screenshot/e2e) run in GitHub Actions. -->

#### Stretch Goals

- Support for Jetpack Compose‚Äôs `androidx.compose.ui` runtime as an alternative backend.
- Hot‚Äëreload/dev‚Äëserver that mirrors Swift file changes directly onto the device.
- VS‚ÄØCode / Xcode template that bootstraps a ready‚Äëto‚Äërun Android‚ÄëSwift workspace.
