**Project size**: 1 month

**Estimated difficulty**: Intermediate

### Recommended Skills

- Familiarity with GNU/Linux internals and tooling
- Experience with shell scripting (Bash, Python, etc.)
- Comfort configuring and compiling the Linux kernel
- (Optional) Knowledge of Debian live-build or Arch ISO tooling
- Basic understanding of UEFI, GRUB, and boot processes

### Description

Building a Linux distribution tailored to a specific set of use cases can dramatically simplify deployment, improve performance, and tighten security. In this project, you will design and implement a **reproducible, automated build pipeline** that produces a custom, bootable ISO image for x86\_64 systems. You’ll start with a minimal base (Debian or Arch), apply a curated kernel configuration, select and preconfigure packages (e.g. a window manager or server stack), and embed system settings—all driven by a single set of scripts.

Key activities include:

1. **Base selection & tooling**
   - Choose Debian live-build or Arch’s `archiso` as your build framework
   - Install and configure the build environment in a container or VM
2. **Kernel customization**
   - Identify and enable only the drivers and features you need
   - Automate kernel compilation and packaging
3. **Package selection & configuration**
   - Define a minimal set of core utilities, libraries, and desktop/server components
   - Preseed configuration files (e.g., `/etc/skel`, systemd unit overrides)
4. **ISO assembly & bootloader**
   - Configure GRUB (or Syslinux) for BIOS/UEFI support
   - Assemble initramfs, squashfs root, and final ISO
5. **Testing & validation**
   - Boot and smoke-test in VirtualBox/QEMU
   - Validate network, storage, and USB persistence scenarios
6. **Documentation & automation**
   - Provide `build.sh` (or `Makefile`) to reproduce every step
   - Write clear README with customization knobs

### Expected Results

- **Reproducible build scripts** in a Git repository that generate:
  - A custom Linux kernel `.deb`/`.pkg.tar.zst`
  - A bootable x86\_64 ISO with your selected packages and settings
- **Boot-tested ISO** that installs and runs in VirtualBox/QEMU without manual intervention
- **Comprehensive documentation** covering:
  - Environment setup
  - Configuration variables (kernel flags, package lists)
  - Steps to rebuild or tweak the distro
- **Example configurations** (e.g., kernel `.config`, package manifest, GRUB config)

#### Stretch Goals

- **aarch64 support**: Extend the build pipeline to emit an ARM64 ISO
- **Real-hardware installer**: Integrate a graphical installer (e.g., Calamares) for USB-to-disk installs
- **Persistent live USB**: Enable live sessions with on-disk persistence
- **Automated testing**: Add CI jobs to spin up QEMU instances and run basic validation scripts
