# {{ $frontmatter.id }}: {{ $frontmatter.title }}

**Project size**: 3 months

**Estimated difficulty**: Hard

### Recommended Skills

- Proficiency in systems programming (Go, Rust, or Python) and CLI development
- Familiarity with Debian packaging (dpkg/apt), Homebrew formula syntax, and WinGet manifest format
- Experience with Nix/Nixpkgs and declarative build definitions
- Knowledge of cross-platform toolchains and binary distribution
- Strong understanding of schema design and data serialization formats (JSON, YAML)

### Description

Across Linux, macOS, and Windows, a diverse set of package managers—apt/dpkg, Homebrew, WinGet, and Nix—each maintain their own manifest formats, build pipelines, and distribution channels. This project will unify that fragmented ecosystem by:

- **Scraping** existing Homebrew formulas and WinGet manifests to extract metadata, dependencies, and build instructions.
- **Designing** a common manifest schema (JSON/YAML) capable of representing package metadata, build steps, and platform-specific variants.
- **Generating** Debian-compatible `.deb` packages from the unified manifest, ready for installation via `dpkg`/`apt`.
- **Porting** core `apt`/`dpkg` binaries to macOS and Windows, enabling basic `.deb` installation workflows outside of Linux.
- **Documenting** the unified format, command-line workflows, and developer guidelines for contributors to extend/adapt to other package ecosystems.

By the end of the summer, the community will have a solid foundation for a single source of truth for package definitions and cross-platform tooling to consume it.

### Expected Results

- **`uni-pkg` CLI toolchain** that can scrape Homebrew and WinGet repositories to produce unified manifest files.
- **Unified manifest schema** specification (JSON/YAML) with reference implementation and example manifests for common packages (e.g., `git`, `node`, `ffmpeg`).
- **Converter module** that transforms unified manifests into Debian `.deb` packages, testable via `dpkg --install`.
- **Prototype `apt`/`dpkg` binaries** compiled for macOS and Windows, supporting basic commands (`install`, `remove`, `list`).
- **Nix adapter layer** exposing an `apt`-style CLI front end that installs packages from Nixpkgs under the hood.
- **Automated test suite** and CI pipelines validating scraping, conversion, package integrity, and cross-platform installs.
- **Comprehensive documentation** and example workflows demonstrating end-to-end package creation and installation on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

#### Stretch Goals

- Add support for additional ecosystems (e.g., Chocolatey, RPM-based distros).
- Enable cross-architecture builds (x86\_64, arm64).
- Develop a web UI for browsing and converting packages in real time.
- Implement automated upstream syncing to keep unified manifests in sync with official repositories.
