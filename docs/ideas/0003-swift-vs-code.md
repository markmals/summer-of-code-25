**Project size**: 1 month

**Estimated difficulty**: Intermediate

### Recommended Skills

- Proficiency in JavaScript/TypeScript & Swift
- Familiarity with Visual Studio Code's extension system and APIs

### Description

As Swift development expands beyond just Apple platforms, it's important that the developer experience keeps up. VS Code has fairly good support for Swift so far, but there are many quality-of-life improvements that can be investigated and made:

- Build and run iOS apps in the simulator via keyboard shortcuts
- Debug iOS apps in the simulator
- Format on save and respect format settings
- Open and edit Xcode project files
- Swift packages GUI
- Easy hot reloading setup and usage?
- Refactoring? Swift version migrations?
- Semantic syntax highlighting from the language server

### Expected Results

- New Visual Studio Code extensions to improve the Swift developer experience
