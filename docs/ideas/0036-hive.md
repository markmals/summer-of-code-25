**Project size**: 3 months

**Estimated difficulty**: Hard

### Recommended Skills

- Proficiency in TypeScript and Node.js
- Experience with VS Code extension development and APIs
- Familiarity with Claude Code and the [Claude Code TypeScript SDK](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/sdk#typescript)
- Knowledge of GitHub API and OAuth workflows
- Experience with [Solid](https://www.solidjs.com)
- Understanding of LLM task management and parallel processing concepts

### Description

Modern AI-powered development tools like Claude Code and OpenAI Codex have revolutionized how developers approach coding tasks, but managing parallel workflows and integrating with existing project management systems remains fragmented. This project will create "Hive" - a comprehensive VS Code extension that unifies task management, AI assistance, and GitHub integration into a single, intuitive interface.

The extension will serve as a central hub for:

1. **Parallel AI Task Management**: Create and manage multiple concurrent AI-powered tasks using Claude Code under the hood, with intelligent task queuing and resource allocation.
2. **Unified Task Lists**: Create and check-off tasks directly in VS Code and pass them to Claude Code's built-in task management.
3. **GitHub Integration**: Assign Hive to work on multiple GitHub Issues at once and see them added to the Parallel Task Manager. When Hive finishes an Issue, it can create a GitHub PR for the developer to leave comments on a do a code review with. For each review the developer submits, Hive will attempt to resolve those specific issues, update the PR, and request another review. You may manually edit the PR at any time to help Hive along.
4. **Run-of-the-Mill AI Editor Features**: Request inline edits to a specific section of code ([⌘K](https://docs.cursor.com/inline-edit/overview)), [chat with Hive about your project](https://docs.cursor.com/agent/chat/tabs) and [provide it context via files or documentation](https://docs.cursor.com/context/@-symbols/overview), [request targeted edits of certain files or directories in the foreground](https://docs.cursor.com/agent/modes#manual), [connect MCP Servers](https://docs.cursor.com/context/mcp), show [phantom completion text that can be applies by pressing the tab key](https://docs.cursor.com/tab/overview), [a bespoke editor interface](https://docs.cursor.com/context/rules) for [CLAUDE.md](https://claude.md), and more.

The extension will feature a modern webview-based interface built with Solid, providing rich visualizations for task progress, AI model performance comparisons, and GitHub activity timelines. Advanced features will include custom prompt templates, automated code review suggestions, and intelligent task dependency mapping.
